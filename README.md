A browser-based editor for GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) transit
data, inspired by geojson.io. Load a feed from a ZIP or a URL, view it on a map,
edit it, and export it again. There is no login and no backend: all data stays
in the browser, in IndexedDB.

## GTFS support

Not every GTFS Schedule file has a dedicated view. See
[docs/gtfs-implementation-status.md](docs/gtfs-implementation-status.md) for
which files have their own editor and which are only in the table viewer.
